# *** THIS IS NOT A JOKE. WE ARE STARTING A NEW RELIGION. ***

# Religion Fusion
Religion Fusion (RF) is a religion that combines the best of most religions. RF shall be referred to as RF, until a catchier name is found. If you have suggestions to add to this list, email me!

# Why
Aren't you tired of religions that are mostly good, but have some bad parts written 1,000 years ago, but can't be updated to reflect reality, because the guy who wrote it declared it as a static global constant? As you can see, this religion is based on a living document. It's on Github, for Jay's sake! (Jay is the guy who started this)

# Motto
Don't Be Evil

# Rules
* Don't kill people
* Killing others to spread or defend RF is totally NOT OK, at all
* Other religions are ok, accept them as human beings too. Even atheists
* But don't be just blindly nice to people. If they're nasty to you, you are allowed to be rude to them, or call the cops (if applicable)
* Don't steal other people's stuff
* Be nice to other people
* Rape is never ok. Sex must be consensual. Even if you're married
* You do not ever own another human being. Wife, husband, child. You cannot take their life

# Meetups
* Totally optional
* If you are interested in meeting up with others in your area, start a local group

# Official RF Food
* Anything is fine

# Official RF Drink
* Anything is fine

# Guilt
We don't do guilt

# Kickstarter
Soon!

# Sacred rock or place or object
There is none

# Religious baggage
There is none

# How do I know if I'm a member of RF?
Just by declaring that you are, or that you aren't

# Commitment
Join and leave anytime you want. Obviously if more people leave than join, then it's feedback that we're doing something wrong and need to evolve

# Volunteer
Email me!

# Immediate need
* Someone who can do some video work pro-bono for the Kickstarter campaign
* A catchy name!

# Forking
Sure, fork away. But why not join forces?

# Fscking
* Anything goes, but if you must do it, don't do it without protection
* Be decent to others. Be respectful and don't be reckless with other people's feelings

# P0rn
Any kind is fine, except child p0rn or animal p0rn
