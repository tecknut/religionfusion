# *** THIS IS NOT A PARODY. WE ARE STARTING A NEW RELIGION ***

# Current Status
Need help with 501(c)(3) incorporation, please get in touch if you have experience.

# Religion Fusion
Religion Fusion (RF) is a religion that combines the best of most religions. Religion Fusion shall be referred to as "RF".

# Is this a joke?
*NO*. [Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jediism) is a religion and nobody is offended by it. Why can't a new religion be formed to promote a better society?

# Why
Aren't you tired of religions that are mostly good, but have some bad parts written 1,000 years ago, but can't be updated to reflect the present day's cultural and societal accepted norms, because the guy who wrote it declared it as a static global constant? As you can see, this religion is based on a living document. It's on Github, for Jay's sake! (Jay is the guy who started this)

# What a new religion should do. What RF seeks to provide
* Promote peace, understanding, good mental and physical health.
* Be dynamically updated to adapt to a changing society.
* Customer service as the core of RF, RF seeks to serve its followers. Not the other way around.

# Motto
Don't Be Evil.

# Rules
* Don't kill people.
  * Unless it's Osama Bin Laden. Then that's totally ok.
* Other religions are ok, accept them as human beings too. Even atheists.
  * If someone feels very strongly about something about their religion, don't try to convince them otherwise. The promotion of peace and tolerance supercedes logical and scientific correctness.
    * That doesn't mean that you have to give up your own beliefs. You are free to believe anything you want, as well as the other person. Agree to disagree.
* But don't be just blindly nice to people. If they're nasty to you, you are allowed to be rude to them, or call the cops (if applicable).
* Don't steal other people's stuff.
* Be nice to other people.
* Rape is never ok. Sex must be consensual. Even if you're married.
* You do not ever own another human being. Wife, husband, child. You cannot take their life.

# Meetups
* Totally optional.
* If you are interested in meeting up with others in your area, start a local group.

# Official RF Food
* Anything is fine.

# Official RF Drink
* Anything is fine.

# Guilt
We don't do guilt.

# Kickstarter
Soon!

# Exclusitivity
None. It's totally fine with RF, if you also participate in other religions. You don't have to denounce your membership with other religions just because you want to be in RF. But if they're not cool with you in being RF, that's between you and them (not in RF's "jurisdiction"). But we're cool if you like us and like others too.

# Sacred rock or place or object
There is no object sacred enough to fight or die over in RF.

# Religious baggage
There is none.

# Promotion / Advocacy of RF
You can talk about RF to others, but do NOT be pushy, or trick them. Per the rule about not allowing killing, killing others to spread or defend RF is totally NOT OK, at all.

# How do I know if I'm a member of RF?
Just by declaring that you are, or that you aren't.

# Commitment
Join and leave anytime you want. Obviously if more people leave than join, then it's feedback that we're doing something wrong and need to evolve.

# Physical health
RF recommends sports as a physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

# Mental health
Mental health is a BIG DEAL. RF recommends activities to improve friendship, widen one's social circle and good parenting. Kind of like A. A., we welcome anyone who needs to see a therapist or need psychological medication. It is not baggage. Gotta take care of your mind, because it's just another muscle in your body. Medication is good too.

# Volunteer
Email me!

# Immediate need
* Someone who can do some video work pro-bono for the Kickstarter campaign.
* A catchy name!

# Forking
Sure, fork away. But why not join forces?

# Fscking
* By default, you must use protection.
  * Unless you and your partner(s) know definitively that none of you have STDs (as verified medically).
  * Unless you understand the financial, mental, and physical costs of bringing up a child.
* Be decent to others. Be respectful and don't be reckless with other people's feelings.

# P0rn
Any kind is fine, except child p0rn or animal p0rn. Former is strongly prohibited, the latter is frowned upon because animals cannot give consent.

# After Life Benefits
We'll get together and provide after life benefits, but we're not entirely sure if we can deliver. So, just to be safe, live a good life in the present.
