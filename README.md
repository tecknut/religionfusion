# Religion Fusion
Religion Fusion (RF) is a religion that combines the best of most religions. RF shall be referred to as RF, until a catchier name is found. If you have suggestions to add to this list, email me!

# Why
Aren't you tired of religions that are mostly good, but have some bad parts written 1,000 years ago, but can't be updated to reflect reality, because the guy who wrote it declared it as a static global constant?

# Motto
Don't Be Evil

# Rules
* Don't kill people
* Other religions are ok, accept them as human beings too
* But don't be just blindly nice to people. If they're nasty to you, you are allowed to be rude to them.
* Don't steal other people's stuff
* Be nice to other people

# Meetups
* Totally optional
* If you are interested in meeting up with others in your area, start a local group.

# Kickstarter
